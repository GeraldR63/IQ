# IQ
Digital life. Good example of multithreaded programming. Works in SUN SPARC environments. POSIX


Tried to rebuild a small brain by using multithreaded programming. Each thread work like a cell. The cells need energy, food, to avoid that this life explodes food 
is required.


I stopped this project because in C/C++ it's difficult to write a software which works on different hardware. The idea was to add code (DNA) and compiler to this to 
give it the ability to compile and modify itself to get better chances for food and reproduction.


Each cell (thread) is able to communicate with each other. Compared to a human brain this would be, if it would work the way planned, much more powerful than
human brain.

However, up to now it's nice to show multithreaded programming.
